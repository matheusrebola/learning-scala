Scala tutorial for programmers - It's a complete series designed to get you started.

This Scala mini-series requires some existing programming background, as I'll be making various analogies to what you may have already seen in other languages. 

We will learn the basics very quickly (how to define values, functions and classes) and then we will go through the Scala-specific features like case classes, pattern matching. We'll also explore some more advanced Scala features, including some asynchronous programming with Futures and enhancing existing types with implicits.

Every example in this Scala mini-series is hands-on, and I invite you to code with me so you can see the effects in action.
